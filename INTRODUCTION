Due to the substantial increase in urban population leading to a significant rise in trash production, waste management poses a challenge in metropolitan areas. Conventional trash management techniques are expensive and ineffective.
These issues can be resolved by making efficient use of available resources, using (IoT) internet of things technologies, utilizing deep learning models. 
The primary aim of this article is to create an intelligent waste management system utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) devices coupled with deep learning algorithms. 
This device makes bin status monitoring easier and improves trash segregation procedures. 
The SSD MobileNetV2 Quantized model has been utilized with the purpose of waste classification and categorization.
It underwent training on a dataset that encompassed various types of waste, such as batteries, cardboard, brown glass, organic waste, footwear, plastic, paper, metal, green glass, white glass, trash, and clothing. 
This model is integrated into TensorFlow Lite and deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4 along with a camera module. 
Once the waste objects are detected by the camera, a servo motor attached to a plastic board classifies them into the appropriate compartments using the classification information supplied by the model.
The ultrasonic sensor keeps track of the percentage of waste filling up the bin, meanwhile, a LoRa module embedded within the smart bin sends the bin's status to a LoRa receiver. 
This model is installed on a Raspberry Pi 4 along with a camera module and incorporated into TensorFlow Lite. 
The servo motor, based on the model's classification, is affixed to a plastic board, effectively partitioning it into the correct divisions. 
A LoRa module mounted on the smart bin transmits the bin's status to a LoRa receiver, while the ultrasonic sensor tracks the level of garbage within the bin.
