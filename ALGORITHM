For Loop over each conv_layer in conv_layers: 
 a. Resize conv_layer to (30, 30) using a lambda function and store it in x 
 b. Apply a 1x1 convolutional layer with relu activation to x 
 c. Apply a 3x3 convolutional layer with softmax activation to x 
 d. Append x to prediction_layers 
 e. Concatenate all prediction_layers 
return final_prediction // Return the concatenated prediction_layers
